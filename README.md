I think that React is a Javascript library that uses JSX syntax to build user interfaces. React is a front end framework that allows for maximum efficiency DOM manipulation, in that it uses component structure and effective data flows to only render changes to the DOM rather than re-render the entire DOM after each change. The only questions I have relate to how to structure the state and props functions in React to get the overall framework to work the way that I want it to; hopefully I will pick this up with some practice.

For extra credit: 1) I enabled page responsiveness (resizing ability) and 2) added some styling components
